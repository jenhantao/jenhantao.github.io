The human genome encodes key determinants for our health in a language that balances a simple alphabet of ACGTs and sophisticated grammar rules that allow for cell type and context specific gene expression. I'm interested in training machine learning models using biological data and then interrogating those models to advance our understanding of the how the genome relates to our health and predisposition to disease.

I am currently a computational biologist at VL56, a [Flagship Pioneering](https://www.flagshippioneering.com).

Previously, I was a bioinformatics scientist at Illumina where I worked to develop computational methods to improve our ability to diagnose cancer using next generation sequencing data.

I completed my PhD studies at UC San Diego, where I applied machine learning techniques to uncover [how the genome is read by transcription factors]([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08236-0]) in the macrophage, a critical component of the innate immune system. My thesis work was supervised by [Dr. Christopher Glass](http://cmm.ucsd.edu/glass/glasslab/about.html) and [Dr. Christopher Benner](http://homer.ucsd.edu/BennerLab/). The Glass lab is best known for the investigation of how transcription of genome is regulated in the context of the macrophage, a cell that plays key roles in immunity and inflammatory diseases.
